# Retail Store Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail store data to extract meaningful insights that can aid in decision-making and strategy formulation. The analysis is conducted using SQL queries on a dataset containing detailed information about retail orders, including order details, product categories, sales prices, quantities sold, discounts applied, and geographic regions.

Objectives
Sales Performance Analysis: Evaluate sales performance metrics such as average order value (AOV), total revenue by segments and product categories, and regional sales trends.

Customer Behavior Understanding: Investigate customer purchasing patterns, including the correlation between discount rates and sales revenue across different product categories.

Product Analysis: Identify top-selling products and product categories based on total sales revenue and average order quantities per city and category.

Regional Insights: Gain insights into regional sales variations, including average order values and total discount amounts given across different geographic regions.

Key Queries
The analysis includes several SQL queries designed to address specific aspects of retail operations:

Average Order Value (AOV): Calculates the average order value for each month to understand seasonal variations in purchasing behavior.

Discount Analysis: Computes the total discount amount provided in each region to assess the impact of promotional strategies on sales.

Segment Revenue: Identifies the top-performing market segments by total revenue to focus marketing and sales efforts effectively.

Top Products: Lists the top 5 products with the highest sales revenue to prioritize inventory management and marketing efforts.

Regional Product Category Analysis: Determines the top product categories by sales revenue in each region to tailor regional marketing campaigns.

Correlation Analysis: Investigates the correlation between discount percentages and total sales revenue across different product categories to optimize pricing and discount strategies.

City-Level Analysis: Identifies the top 3 cities with the highest average order quantities for each product category to localize marketing efforts and inventory stocking.

Regional AOV Analysis: Calculates the average order value for each product category across different regions to understand regional purchasing power and preferences.

Highest AOV by Category and Region: Determines the highest average order value for each product category in specific regions to target high-value customer segments effectively.
